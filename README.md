# Poor's man debugger

<h3>ðŸš§ Under development, it works but some stuff might change in the future.</h3>

<hr>

The most simple way to debug your code.

This is a simple TUI debugger, it starts a local server that accepts payloads from the adapters. Everything goes through HTTP requests, so it's very fast compared to other solutions.
You can think of it as a console.log(), but instead of the browser you use the terminal and it works with any language.

## Requirements

- PMD-adapter for your language installed in the project.

## Installation

 You can install it via cargo.
 
  1. Install cargo (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
  2. Run `cargo install pmd`

## Configuration

The default config is located at ~/.config/pmd/config.toml (for UNIX like systems) or ~/.pmd/config.toml (for Windows).

You can override the default config by passing a -c (--config) flag that points to the config.toml file.

### Keybindings

Keybindings are VIM-like. The `leader` key is set by default to `,` , but you can override this via config.

Debugger consists of three input states
  - Normal
  - Visual
  - Inspection
  
### Normal

 Normal mode enables you to scroll all the breakpoints and callstack data.
 
 It has the following keybindings:
 
   - `j` (or `Down arrow`) -> Move down the list
   - `k` (or `Up arrow`) -> Move up the list
   - `<leader> + h` -> Move to the left
   - `<leader> + l` -> Move to the right
   - `i` -> Set inspection mode, to inspect the dumped variables
   - `v` -> Set visual mode and open the selected breakpoint/callstack in a popup for more details.
   - `q` -> Quit
   
 ### Visual
 
  Visual mode is meant to show additional data that are not present in normal mode for breakpoints/callstack.
  
  It has the following keybindings:
  
   - `q` -> Quit
   - `ESC` -> Go to normal mode
   
 ### Inspection
 
  Inspection mode enables you to inspect the tree-like data that were sent by the adapters.
  
  It has the following keybindings:
  
   - `j` (or `Down arrow`) -> Move down the tree
   - `k` (or `Up arrow`) -> Move up the tree
   - `h` -> Close the selected item
   - `l` -> Expand selected item.
   - `q` -> Quit
   - `ESC` -> Go to normal mode


## Adapters

Adapters are language specific packages that sends the actual debug data to PMD via HTTP.

Currently supported

  - PHP (https://github.com/nkoporec/pmd-php}
  

### Adapter API

An example API for an adapter

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:6969/dump \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
        "timestamp": "3223232",
        "line": "6",
        "connector_type": "php",
        "filepath": "/home/project/drupal/web/index.php",
        "callstack": [
                {
                        "filepath": "/home/project/drupal/web/index.php",
                        "line": "10"
                }
        ],
        "payload": ""
}'
```

Types:
 - timestamp -> String
 - line -> String
 - connector_type -> String
 - filepath -> String
 - callstack -> Array (where key is a line number (int), and value is a file path (string)
 - payload -> JSON encoded string

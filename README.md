# Poor's man debugger

<h3>ðŸš§ Under development, it works but some stuff might change in the future.</h3>

<hr>

The most simple way to debug your code.

This is a simple TUI debugger, it starts a local server that accepts payloads from the adapters. Everything goes through HTTP requests, so it's very fast compared to other solutions.
You can think of it as a console.log(), but instead of the browser you use the terminal and it works with any language.

### Adapter API

An example API for an adapter

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3000/dump \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"timestamp": "3223232",
	"line": "6",
	"connector_type": "php",
	"filepath": "/home/nkoporec/personal/drupal/web/index.php",
	"callstack": [
		"10:/home/nkoporec/personal/drupal/web/index.php",
		"100:/home/nkoporec/personal/drupal/web/index.php",
		"2213:/home/nkoporec/personal/drupal/web/index.php"
	],
	"payload": ""
}'
```

Types:
 - timestamp -> String
 - line -> String
 - connector_type -> String
 - filepath -> String
 - callstack -> Array (where key is a line number (int), and value is a file path (string)
 - payload -> JSON encoded string
